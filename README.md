# Pattern Lab Theses

*"I think and I know things."*

This repository contains the public theses from [Pattern Lab](https://alanpentz.com) — a living system for discovering, testing, and refining macro patterns.

## What's Here

Each thesis is a markdown file in `/theses/` that evolves over time. The git history shows how my thinking has changed as new signals emerge.

**Active Theses:**
- [AI & Knowledge Work](theses/ai-knowledge-work.md) — How AI transforms professional services
- [Reshoring & Deglobalization](theses/reshoring.md) — Manufacturing coming home
- [Inflation Pressures](theses/inflation.md) — Structural inflation beyond the cycle
- [Aging Demographics](theses/demographics.md) — Not just healthcare
- [US-China Competition](theses/us-china.md) — Technology decoupling
- [Pattern Lab (Meta)](theses/pattern-lab.md) — The methodology behind the methodology

## How Theses Evolve

1. **Signals** — Evidence that supports, challenges, or evolves a thesis
2. **Community Input** — Submit signals at [alanpentz.com](https://alanpentz.com)
3. **Updates** — When enough signals accumulate, the thesis gets updated
4. **Version History** — Every change is tracked in git

## Contributing

The best way to contribute is to **submit a signal** on the website. Signals are evidence — articles, data, observations — that support or challenge a thesis.

If you want to propose a direct edit to thesis text, you can open a PR. But be warned: I'm opinionated about my own thinking.

## About Pattern Lab

Pattern Lab is where I test my macro investing theses in public. The goal isn't to be right — it's to be less wrong over time.

**Tell me why I'm wrong.**
