# Foreign Investment Into US Remains Steady, Challenging Deglobalization Narrative

## Signal

Bob Elliott of Unlimited Funds analyzes actual foreign investment flow data into the US across FDI, bonds, deposits, lending, and equities. Despite heated narratives from both partisans claiming either a $17T investment boom or a dollar/bond collapse, the data shows remarkably little change.

Key findings:
- **Total foreign investment** ticked up modestly, running at the top end of the post-GFC range
- **Foreign direct investment** remains subdued and "has hardly budged over the last few years"
- **Bond/treasury buying** looks largely the same as recent years
- **Foreign central banks** haven't been buying treasuries for over a decade
- **Equity buying** is the one area that shifted positively — renewed purchases at the higher end of recent years, likely supporting US stocks in 2025
- **Bank lending and deposits** from foreign sources show minimal movement

THESIS CONNECTION: If deglobalization were truly accelerating at the pace the narrative suggests, foreign capital flows should be declining meaningfully. Instead they're flat to slightly up. This suggests deglobalization may be real in goods and supply chains but has not yet translated to capital flows. Capital is stickier than supply chains, and the broad financial system remains deeply integrated despite trade-level decoupling.

INVESTOR IMPLICATIONS: The "meh" in the data favors a weaker dollar and relative outperformance of foreign equities on the margin. The equity flow tailwind that supported US stocks in 2025 could revert to mean. Investors pricing in full financial decoupling are ahead of the capital reality.

BUSINESS OWNER PERSPECTIVE: For $2-10M business owners watching reshoring narratives, this data suggests the financial infrastructure supporting global business hasn't changed. Access to foreign capital, banking relationships, and investment flows remain stable. The reshoring opportunity is real in physical supply chains, but don't overweight the urgency — capital markets aren't panicking about deglobalization.
