# Semantic Methods Transform Strategic Planning: Capabilities as Vectors

## Signal

Research from Di Rubbo et al. applies computational linguistics to strategy—treating organizational elements like words in a semantic space where collective action conveys meaning.

**The translation:**
- Capabilities/teams/business units encoded as multidimensional vectors (skills, resources, culture, market position)
- Strategic postures (growth, defend, pivot) represented as semantic constructs
- Vector distance metrics measure strategic "fit" and competitive gap exploitation

**Why this matters for AI + knowledge work:**
AI doesn't just augment individual knowledge workers—it can encode and reason about entire organizational capabilities the way LLMs reason about text. This means:
- 30 years of NLP advances (embeddings, attention, transformers) become applicable to strategy
- M&A target evaluation becomes "does this acquisition complete our sentence?"
- Strategic planning becomes semantic computation
- Competitive analysis becomes vector space positioning

**Agentic application:** A multi-agent system where Capability Encoder, Market Encoder, Strategy Generator, and Gap Analyzer agents work in a swarm to produce strategic recommendations—with an Antagonist agent challenging weak reasoning.
