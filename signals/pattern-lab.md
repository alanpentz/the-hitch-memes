**Community Value: Participation With Stakes**

Most thought leader communities offer access (to thinker or to each other). This model offers participation with stakes:
- Impact: Your signal might actually change the thesis
- Attribution: Permanent credit, not throwaway comments
- Skill development: Learning to spot and articulate signals
- Reputation: Portfolio of thinking quality across thinkers

Contributors become junior partners in the thinking process, not just audience. This creates 100 true fans with buy-in.
