  The US-China relationship is the structural fault line running under every
  major geopolitical and economic trend of the next decade. Trade, technology,
  military posture, and alliance systems are all being reshaped by this competition.

# US-China Great Power Competition

## The Core Argument

Every major US foreign policy decision now has a Pacific price tag. Aircraft carriers sent to the Middle East are carriers not contesting the South China Sea. Semiconductor export controls aimed at China reshape global supply chains. Technology investment restrictions create parallel innovation ecosystems.

This isn't a new Cold War — the economic interdependence is orders of magnitude deeper than the US-Soviet relationship ever was. It's something without clean historical precedent: two deeply intertwined economies preparing for the possibility that the intertwining ends.

> **Key Claim:** Military posture in the Pacific is the binding constraint on US Middle East policy.

## The Structural Dynamics

The US maintains 11 carrier strike groups. Maintenance cycles, training requirements, and transit times mean only three to four are deployable at any given time. Every carrier sent to the Middle East — and the pattern since October 2023 has been persistent presence — is one fewer in the Western Pacific.

China doesn't need the US to be weak. It needs the US to be busy.

The January 2026 trilateral strategic pact between Iran, China, and Russia formalized what was already operational: coordination designed to stretch American attention across multiple theaters. This isn't conspiracy — it's basic strategy. A unipolar power's vulnerability is geographic overextension.

## The Technology Front

Export controls on advanced semiconductors, AI chips, and manufacturing equipment represent the sharpest edge of the competition. The October 2022 controls were unprecedented in peacetime — effectively treating advanced computing as a munition.

China's response has been predictable and effective: massive investment in domestic alternatives. SMIC's progress on advanced nodes, while still behind TSMC, demonstrates that controls slow but don't stop capability development. The question is whether the gap narrows or widens over the next five years.

## What to Watch

**Carrier deployment patterns**: The ratio of Pacific-to-Middle East carrier presence is a real-time indicator of US strategic priorities. When that ratio drops below 1:1, the Pacific gap becomes a structural feature, not a temporary condition.

**Technology self-sufficiency milestones**: Each Chinese breakthrough in domestic chip manufacturing, AI model capability, or quantum computing reduces the leverage of export controls and accelerates the decoupling timeline.

**Alliance system stress tests**: AUKUS, the Quad, and bilateral defense agreements with Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines are the infrastructure of Pacific deterrence. Watch for gaps between rhetoric and actual capability deployment.

**Economic interdependence metrics**: US-China bilateral trade, cross-border investment flows, and supply chain diversification rates tell you whether decoupling is accelerating or reaching natural limits.
