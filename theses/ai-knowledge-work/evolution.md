## v3.0 - 2026-01-04

**Major** | Context Graphs emerge as infrastructure layer

The thesis evolved significantly to incorporate the Context Graphs concept from Foundation Capital's research. This represents a shift from purely describing the "what" of AI transformation to identifying the "where"—the specific infrastructure opportunity that creates durable moats.

> Context graphs—not just data—are the infrastructure layer that makes AI agents effective.

**Triggering Signals:**
- Foundation Capital Context Graphs research (December 2025)
- Enterprise AI implementations failing due to missing contextual layer
- Accumulating evidence that systems of record alone are insufficient

## v2.0 - 2025-06-15

**Major** | Knowledge Programmer role crystallizes

Added the Knowledge Programmer framework as a distinct concept. This represents the emergence of a new role archetype—not traditional developer, not traditional analyst, but AI-fluent generalist who orchestrates capabilities.

> "Iron Man suit, not Skynet"—human judgment amplified by AI systems.

**Triggering Signals:**
- Early adopter case studies showing 10x productivity gains
- Emerging demand for AI workflow orchestration skills
- Resistance from traditional software engineering community

## v1.5 - 2025-01-20

**Minor** | Token economics acceleration

Updated economic projections as inference costs dropped faster than anticipated. The 50-100x cost reduction since 2022 invalidated some skeptical signals about AI adoption barriers.

**Triggering Signals:**
- GPT-4 Turbo pricing at 3x reduction
- Claude 3 launch with competitive pricing
- Enterprise procurement cycles shortening

## v1.0 - 2024-08-01

**Major** | Initial thesis formulation

Original hypothesis established: AI will restructure knowledge work within 36 months, with early adopters gaining compounding advantages.

**Triggering Signals:**
- Initial research and observations
- ChatGPT enterprise adoption patterns
- Professional services firm experimentation
