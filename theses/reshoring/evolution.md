## v1.8 - 2024-12-21

**Refinement** | Professional services demand quantified

Updated to include $40B+ professional services demand estimate as reshoring creates derivative opportunities beyond manufacturing itself.

**Triggering Signals:**
- BCG reshoring advisory practice growth
- Big 4 supply chain practice expansions
- GovCon reshoring-related RFPs increasing

---

## v1.5 - 2024-09-15

**Minor** | Supply chain resilience overtakes cost

Adjusted framing from "cost doesn't matter" to "resilience matters more." The calculus shifted after continued semiconductor supply disruptions and auto industry lessons.

> Labor costs matter less than supply chain resilience in the new calculus.

**Triggering Signals:**
- Auto OEM reshoring announcements
- Semiconductor fab construction timelines
- Insurance pricing for supply chain risk

## v1.3 - 2024-07-20

**Refinement** | Bipartisan policy consensus solidifies

Updated to reflect that reshoring has become rare bipartisan agreement. CHIPS Act implementation, IRA manufacturing incentives, and continued tariff policies across administrations.

**Triggering Signals:**
- Biden administration CHIPS Act funding
- Continued Trump-era tariff policies
- State-level manufacturing incentive competition

## v1.0 - 2024-06-15

**Major** | Initial thesis formulation

Original hypothesis: 30% of China-dependent supply chains will have US alternatives by 2028, driven by pandemic awareness transforming into policy consensus.

**Triggering Signals:**
- Initial research and observations
- Pandemic supply chain disruptions
- US-China decoupling acceleration
