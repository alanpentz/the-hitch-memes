# AI & Knowledge Work

## The Core Argument

Knowledge work is facing an inflection point that most don't recognize yet. The same forces that automated manufacturing in the 1980s are now coming for cognitive tasks—but faster, and with different winners and losers.

> **Key Claim:** Within 36 months, the unit economics of expertise delivery will invert. Organizations that previously competed on talent density will compete on AI leverage ratios.

This isn't about chatbots handling customer service. It's about the fundamental restructuring of how knowledge gets created, validated, and delivered. The analyst who took 40 hours to prepare a report will do it in 4. The team that needed 10 people for research will need 2 with the right tools.

## The Knowledge Programmer

A new role is emerging: the **Knowledge Programmer**. This person isn't a traditional software developer—they're an AI-fluent generalist who can build agent systems, orchestrate workflows, and amplify their own expertise 10x.

Key characteristics:
- Deep domain knowledge in at least one area
- Fluency with AI tools and prompt engineering
- Systems thinking—sees how to chain capabilities together
- Comfort with ambiguity and rapid iteration

> "Iron Man suit, not Skynet"—human judgment amplified by AI systems.

## Who Moves First?

Large enterprises will adopt AI slowly—procurement cycles, compliance requirements, change management overhead. But smaller, more agile organizations have both the pain and the capacity to move fast.

The knowledge workers who transform first share common traits: curiosity about new tools, willingness to experiment publicly, and small enough scope that one person can drive change without committee approval.

> "The best time to adopt AI was a year ago. The second best time is before your competitors do."

## Token Economics

The cost of AI inference is dropping 50-100x since 2022, and the trend continues. This creates a new economic reality:

- Tasks that were "too expensive to automate" become trivial
- Quality that required senior experts becomes accessible
- Scale that required teams becomes achievable by individuals

The implications compound: as costs drop, more use cases become viable, which drives more investment, which drives costs down further.

## What I'm Watching

Three signals I'm tracking to validate or invalidate this thesis:

**1. AI tool adoption curves** — Are knowledge workers adopting AI tools faster than the base rate of enterprise software? Early data says yes.

**2. Pricing pressure** — Are clients starting to expect AI-speed delivery at AI-era prices? Not yet, but the conversation is starting.

**3. Talent market shifts** — Are "AI-native" workers commanding premiums, or is AI fluency becoming table stakes? The former, for now.

## Implications

If this thesis holds, the strategic implications are significant:

1. **Invest in AI fluency now** — The learning curve is your moat
2. **Rethink how you measure productivity** — Output per person will vary 10x based on AI leverage
3. **Focus on judgment and relationships** — AI handles the work, humans handle the trust
4. **Prepare for consolidation** — AI-native organizations will outcompete laggards
