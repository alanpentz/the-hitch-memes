# Reshoring & Deglobalization

## The Core Argument

The 40-year experiment in global supply chain optimization is ending. What started as pandemic-driven awareness has become bipartisan policy consensus: critical manufacturing must come home.

This isn't protectionism dressed up in new language. It's a fundamental repricing of risk. The calculus that made it "efficient" to source from the lowest-cost producer assumed stable geopolitics, reliable shipping, and abundant energy. None of those assumptions hold anymore.

> **Key Claim:** 30% of China-dependent supply chains will have US or allied-nation alternatives by 2028.

## Why Now?

Three forces converging simultaneously:

**1. Geopolitical reality** — The US-China relationship has fundamentally shifted. Taiwan risk alone is forcing companies to rethink semiconductor dependencies.

**2. Policy support** — CHIPS Act, IRA, and bipartisan reshoring incentives create financial tailwinds for domestic production.

**3. Automation economics** — Robotics and AI narrow the labor cost gap. When labor is 10% of cost instead of 40%, proximity to customers matters more.

## What This Means for Investors

The obvious plays (construction, industrial automation) are already priced. The second-order effects are not:

- **Professional services demand** — New factories need accountants, lawyers, HR consultants who understand manufacturing
- **Regional banking** — Manufacturing belt banks will finance the buildout
- **Workforce housing** — Factory towns need homes, and workers need services
- **Energy infrastructure** — Manufacturing is energy-intensive; grid buildout follows

## What I'm Watching

**1. Factory announcement velocity** — Are new announcements accelerating or plateauing?

**2. Supply chain cost data** — Is domestic production actually more expensive, or is the gap narrowing?

**3. Skilled labor constraints** — Are workforce bottlenecks slowing the buildout?

## The Connection to Other Theses

Reshoring intersects with nearly every other thesis I track:

- **Inflation** — Domestic production costs more in the short term, contributing to structural inflation
- **AI & Knowledge Work** — Professional services demand from reshoring benefits AI-native firms
- **Demographics** — Aging workforce constrains manufacturing labor availability
