# Context Graphs

> **Adopted Thesis** — Originated by Foundation Capital (Jaya Gupta & Ashu Garg, December 2025). Tracking and evolving here with attribution.

## The Core Argument

Enterprise software has created trillion-dollar companies by owning canonical data—Salesforce owns customer records, Workday owns employee data, SAP owns transactions. But there's a missing layer: the **context** that actually runs businesses.

> **Key Claim:** Systems of record store what SHOULD happen. Context graphs store WHY exceptions exist, what precedents apply, and how decisions actually get made.

This context currently lives in:
- Slack threads and email chains
- Escalation calls and tribal knowledge
- The heads of experienced employees
- Scattered notes and unstructured documentation

As AI agents become the interface for knowledge work, they need access to this contextual layer. Rules tell agents what to do in standard cases. Context tells them how to handle the 80% of real-world situations that aren't standard.

## The Two Layers

| Layer | What It Contains | Who Owns It |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| **Systems of Record** | Canonical data, standard workflows | Salesforce, SAP, Workday |
| **Context Graphs** | Decision traces, exceptions, precedent | *Emerging opportunity* |

Most enterprise AI implementations fail because they connect agents to systems of record but ignore context. The agent can see the customer's order history but not why they got a special exception last time.

## Connection to Knowledge Programmers

This thesis extends the [AI & Knowledge Work](/thesis/ai-knowledge-work) thesis. Knowledge Programmers don't just orchestrate agents—they build and maintain the context graphs that make agents actually useful.

**The KP's Context Graph work:**
1. Capturing decision traces from domain experts
2. Structuring exceptions and precedents
3. Building cross-system contextual connections
4. Maintaining the "why" layer as business evolves

This is durable, high-value work—not just prompting.

## The Open Source Parallel

Git solved this for code:
- **Commits** = what changed
- **Commit messages + PRs** = why it changed
- **Blame/history** = who contributed

Context graphs solve this for business decisions:
- **Decision records** = what was decided
- **Rationale + exceptions** = why it was decided that way
- **Attribution** = who approved it

## What I'm Watching

**1. Enterprise context capture tools** — Are companies building systems to capture decision traces, or just bolting AI onto existing systems of record?

**2. Agent failure patterns** — When agents fail, is it because they lack data or because they lack context? Early evidence suggests context is the bottleneck.

**3. Knowledge Programmer emergence** — Are the most effective KPs the ones who build context systems, not just orchestrate agents?

## Implications

1. **The infrastructure play** — Whoever owns enterprise context graphs has a moat as durable as Salesforce's customer data
2. **KP differentiation** — Knowledge Programmers who build context systems are more valuable than those who just use agents
3. **Pattern Lab connection** — This platform is itself a context graph for ideas—decision traces, signal attribution, thesis evolution
