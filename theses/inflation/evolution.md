This document tracks how this thesis has evolved based on accumulating signals.
Each entry links to the signals that drove the change.

## v2.1 - 2024-12-19

**Refinement** | Status changed to "evolving"

Thesis status changed from "active" to "evolving" as conflicting signals accumulated. Disinflation in goods offset by persistent services inflation. The structural thesis remains intact but timeline and magnitude require revision.

**Triggering Signals:**
- Core PCE declining faster than expected
- Services inflation remaining sticky
- Fed rate cut timing debates

---

## v2.0 - 2024-08-10

**Major** | Deglobalization inflation link strengthened

Major update to explicitly connect reshoring thesis to inflation pressures. Deglobalization is inherently inflationary—this became a key claim as manufacturing return costs became clearer.

> Deglobalization is inherently inflationary.

**Triggering Signals:**
- CHIPS Act implementation cost overruns
- Reshoring labor cost premium data
- Import substitution pricing studies

## v1.5 - 2024-06-01

**Minor** | Labor scarcity framing

Refined to emphasize structural vs cyclical labor scarcity. Demographics and immigration policy create persistent tightness that Fed policy alone cannot resolve.

**Triggering Signals:**
- JOLTS data showing persistent openings
- Immigration policy debates
- Demographics aging workforce data

---

## v1.0 - 2024-05-01

**Major** | Initial thesis formulation

Original hypothesis: The 2021-2023 inflation spike was not aberration but leading edge. Inflation will average 3-4% through 2030.

**Triggering Signals:**
- Initial research and observations
- Post-pandemic inflation persistence
- Disinflationary force reversal analysis
